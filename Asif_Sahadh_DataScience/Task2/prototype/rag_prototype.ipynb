    "The document overall contains 3 modalities: text, image & table. The idea is to sequentially store each of these inside an array. The text data is taken as is, the image data is first passed into an LLM to gets its detailed description. Similar operation is performed on table data. These are stored into the data array.<br><br>\n",
    "Next, they are divided into chunks, where the chunking strategy is overlap. These chunks are converted to vector embeddings using the sentence transformer model `all-mpnet-base-v2`, which converts the data into a 768-dimensional vector. Next, the user query is also converted into its vector using the same embedding model. Cosine similarity is performed to get the top-k indices. Using this, we retrieve the text data from the chunks array.<br><br>\n",
    "Finally, we pass the original user query and the retrieved top-k text chunks and pass it into an LLM for getting the final response.<br><br><br>\n",

    "2. For processing tables and for the final LLM that processes the user query based on the final context, the model is sourced from Groq Cloud (`gpt-oss-120b`). This in my testing was very fast.\n",
    "3. Processing images locally via running the VLM locally is very time consuming. Processing 4 pages entirely using the data extraction pipeline (see function `extract_multimodal_data`) took almost 40 minutes. For this reason, image processing is only done for 30 of the 195 pages."

    "The idea is to ultimately save everything in text form. Text data will be extracted as it is, while the images and tables will be passed to an LLM with respective prompts to get their textual descriptions. Another important point is to maintain the sequence. For example if there is an image after a table in one page, the final `data_array` should have the image description after the table description. This is because if a table / image exists in a page, it is possible that the text surrounding that table / image serves as a description for that table / image. Therefore, maintaining the sequence can be better as this may benefit when chunking where similar information is still together.<br><br>\n",
